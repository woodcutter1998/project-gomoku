# cse237-project

## What user stories were completed this iteration?
The most important  user story that we completed during this iteration is a basic two human players game. It is supportted by a complete UI design and front-end implementation, and a modulized backend game coordinator.

## What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
- The tutorial session. It requires a new UI design for tutorial choosing page along with its frontend implementation.
- Load/save game feature. This is easy to implement. We plan to use local file to store a game and read the file into a game upon loading request.
- A complete navigation system, in which users can navigate between game page, tutorial page, entry page freely.

## Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
- We plan to use the Controller to coordinate all the events happenning in the app. However, since some parts are not missing, it only serves a wrapper of the frontend, we will enable it in next iteration.

## What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
- Simply run the run.sh shell file using Bash or any linux cmd.
